Practical 1
Using Packet Tracer, create a basic network of two computers using appropriate
network wire. Use Static IP address allocation and show connectivity


1- Drag two pc's connect with normal wire
2- GO TO ip config > give unique ipv4 two both pcs (192.168.0.1, 192.168.0.2)
3 - Go to command prompt and type ping 192.168.0.1 in pc1, same with pc2 but use ip of pc1
4 - Select a packet and click on simulation

Practical 2 - create basic network of minimum 6 computer using layer tool switch

1- Take 6pcs and 1 switch(2960) connect with copper wire
2 - Give uinque ip to every pc
3 - (optional) ping every pc done

Practical 3 - create a triangular network each switch contain 5pcs

1 - Take 3 switches and 15 pcs and connect pc with switch using copper straight wire
2 - Give ipv4 to  every pc

Practical 4 - using cmd, execute following networking commands and note the outputs , ping traceroute, netstat, arp, ipconfig, hostname, NSLookup, pathpins

(input this in cmd directly)
ping youtube.com
tracert youtube.com
netstat
arp -a
ipconfig
hostname
nslookup google.com
pathping 192.168.43.157


Practical 5 - create a basic network of one server and two computers using appropriate network wire use dynamic ip address and show connectivity

1 - Take 2 pcs connect to switch and then connect switch to server with normal wire
2 - go to ip > switch to dhcp ip in both pcs and server

Practical 6 - create a basic network of one server and two computers and two mobile usirg appropriate network wire 

1 - take 2 pc connect to a switch,  connect that switch to a server and with access point and add two smart phones
2 - go to ip > switch to dhcp ip in both pcs and server and mobile

Practical 7 - create a basic network of multiple topology using appropriate wire show connectivity

Star (pract2)
1 - 6pcs and 1 switch

Bus
1 - 4 switch 4 pc connect (Each pc with its own switch) and switch to switch
2 - Give uinque ip to every pc

Ring
1 - 4 switch 4 pc connect (Each pc with its own switch) and switch to switch
2 - Give uinque ip to every pc

Mesh
1 - 4 switch 4 pc connect (Each pc with its own switch) and every switch to every switch
2 - Give uinque ip to every pc

Practical 8 - create a network with three routers with RIPv1 of each routr associated network will have minimum three pc 

1 - take 3 switch and connect 3pcs to each switch, connect router to every switch
2 - connect every pc to its switch and give a ip to pc and default gateway
3 - switch to router conncet with normal wire, 
4 - in router add hwic-2t, connect router to router 
5 - Now goto router > physical > interface (jo port mai switch connnect hai) and put the default gateway , turn it on
6 - Serial port no daalo, 
7 - Rip  mai default gateway but last mai 0 and serial port jisse connected hai

Practical 9 - create a network with three routers with RIPv2 of each routr associated network will have minimum three pc 

1 - same as practical 8
2 - go to cli  > Router(config-router)#version 2

Practical 11 - create a wireless network of multiple pcs using appropriate access point
1 - Take 5 pcs and 1 access point
2 - remove the inbuilt module and add PT-Host-NM-1W
3 - add ipvm (or use dhcp)

Practical 13 - create a network with three routers with ospf and each router associated network will have minimum three pc and show connectivity

1 - mostly like practical 8
2 - just dont do rip
3 - open router cli > Router(config-router)#router ospf 1, Router(config-router)#network 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 area 1
Router(config-router)#network 10.0.0.1 0.0.0.255 area 1

Practical 14 - create a network with 3 pcs and each router associated network will have minimum three pc and show connectivity

1 - mostly like practical 8
2 - just dont do rip
3 - open router cli > Router(config-router)#router bgp 1000
network 10.0.0.1
network 192.168.10
neighbor 10.0.0.2 as 2000
